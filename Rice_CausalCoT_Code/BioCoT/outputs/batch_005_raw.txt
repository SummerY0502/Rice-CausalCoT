      "S1": {
        "label": "S1b",
        "reason": "The gene lies at ~1.93 Mb on rice chromosome 1, which does not overlap the major Saltol QTL interval (chr1 ~11.1–14.6 Mb) nor recent seedling-stage salinity QTLs mapped at ~38.3–38.95 Mb on chr1; therefore no credible overlap with main-effect salinity QTLs."

      "S2": {
        "label": "S2b",
        "reason": "OsCML16 is a Ca2+-binding calmodulin-like sensor implicated in abiotic stress signaling and root growth/chilling response, but it is not established as a pivotal regulator within core rice salinity tolerance modules (e.g., SOS/CBL–CIPK, HKT1;5-mediated Na+ exclusion)."

      "S3": {
        "label": "S3b",
        "reason": "While Ca2+ signaling pathways exist in rice, there is no specific pathway record linking OsCML16 directly to a rice salinity tolerance pathway component in KEGG/Plant Reactome."

        "label": "S4b",
        "reason": "No ortholog/homolog of OsCML16 with demonstrated causal effects on salt tolerance was found in related model crops; reported salinity phenotypes involve other CMLs (e.g., Arabidopsis CML13/14) or rice paralogs, not clear OsCML16 orthologs."

      "Conservative": "No",
      "reason": "Neither S5a nor the full combination (S1a+S2a+S3a+S4a) is satisfied; evidence for a direct causal role of OsCML16 in rice salinity tolerance is lacking.",
      "Exploratory": "No",
      "reason": "None of S1a, S2a, S3a, S4a, or S5a is met for OsCML16 with respect to rice salt tolerance.",
      "summary": "OsCML16 (chr1:1.93 Mb) encodes a Ca2+-binding calmodulin-like sensor involved in abiotic stress signaling and root growth/chilling responses. It does not colocalize with major rice salinity QTLs (e.g., Saltol or recent chr1 QTLs near ~38 Mb), lacks pathway-level linkage to a defined rice salt tolerance module, has no homolog evidence directly tied to salt tolerance, and currently lacks rice genetic validation demonstrating a causal effect on salt tolerance. Overall, the evidence does not support OsCML16 as a causal determinant for rice salinity tolerance.",
