      "S1": {
        "label": "S1b",
        "reason": "The gene lies at chr1:0.0728–0.0783 Mb, which does not overlap major rice salinity QTL intervals such as Saltol on chr1 (~11.1–14.6 Mb) or other reported chr1 salinity QTLs mapped near ~38.3–38.9 Mb; therefore, no credible QTL overlap at this locus."

      "S2": {
        "label": "S2a",
        "reason": "GO and description indicate an SR-like pre-mRNA splicing factor (RNA-binding, splicing regulator). SR splicing regulators are pivotal in abiotic stress response modules in rice; OsSCR106 functions as a central regulator of stress-responsive splicing under NaCl stress."

      "S3": {
        "label": "S3b",
        "reason": "No authoritative KEGG or Plant Reactome pathway entry directly annotates OsSCR106 to a defined rice salt-tolerance pathway (e.g., ion homeostasis/ABA modules). Its role is regulatory splicing rather than a curated pathway component."

      "S4": {
        "label": "S4a",
        "reason": "Homologous SR splicing factors in Arabidopsis (e.g., SR45) causally modulate salt tolerance; loss-of-function mutants are salt-sensitive and complementation rescues tolerance, supporting conserved functional relevance of SR splicing regulators to salinity."

        "label": "S5a",
        "reason": "In Oryza sativa, a peer-reviewed study shows scr106 loss-of-function mutants are hypersensitive to NaCl and complementation with OsSCR106 restores tolerance; salt keywords appear in title/abstract and the study includes causal genetic validation in rice.",

      "summary": "OsSCR106 (OS01G0101600) encodes an SR-like splicing factor on chr1 at ~0.073 Mb. It does not co-localize with major rice salinity QTLs (e.g., Saltol). Mechanistically, it is a central regulator of stress-responsive RNA splicing. Orthologous SR factors in Arabidopsis affect salt tolerance. Critically, rice loss-of-function and complementation experiments demonstrate OsSCR106 causally modulates Oryza sativa salt tolerance, supporting strong evidence.",
