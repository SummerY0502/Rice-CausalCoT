      "summary": "RBBI3-3 (Os01g0124401; OsBBTI5) lies outside major rice salinity QTLs on chr1 but encodes a Bowman–Birk protease inhibitor functioning in the apoplast. Experimental work in rice shows that OsBBTI5 RNAi enhances salt tolerance and modulates ROS-related enzymes, consistent with its interaction with OsAPX2 and involvement in ROS/hormone stress pathways. Cross-species data on BBI homologs further support a conserved role in abiotic stress tolerance. Collectively, the gene meets stringent direct-evidence criteria (S5a) for influencing rice salinity tolerance.",
