OS01G0101600,OsSCR106,S1b,S2a,"GO and description indicate an SR-like pre-mRNA splicing factor (RNA-binding, splicing regulator). SR splicing regulators are pivotal in abiotic stress response modules in rice; OsSCR106 functions as a central regulator of stress-responsive splicing under NaCl stress.",S3b,"No authoritative KEGG or Plant Reactome pathway entry directly annotates OsSCR106 to a defined rice salt-tolerance pathway (e.g., ion homeostasis/ABA modules). Its role is regulatory splicing rather than a curated pathway component.",S4a,"Homologous SR splicing factors in Arabidopsis (e.g., SR45) causally modulate salt tolerance; loss-of-function mutants are salt-sensitive and complementation rescues tolerance, supporting conserved functional relevance of SR splicing regulators to salinity.",S5a,"In Oryza sativa, a peer-reviewed study shows scr106 loss-of-function mutants are hypersensitive to NaCl and complementation with OsSCR106 restores tolerance; salt keywords appear in title/abstract and the study includes causal genetic validation in rice.",Yes,Yes
Os01g0102800,CSB,S1b,S2b,"Functional annotations indicate a CSB/ERCC6-like Snf2 chromatin-remodeling ATPase involved in DNA repair/transcriptional processes. While chromatin regulation can modulate stress-responsive genes, CSB is not an established pivotal regulator within central rice salinity tolerance modules (e.g., ion homeostasis SOS/HKT/NHX, ABA core TFs).",S3b,Pathway resources emphasize CSB roles in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and chromatin remodeling; no direct mapping to rice salinity-specific pathways (ion transport/ABA/salt tolerance modules) was found using RAP/Ensembl; hence no pathway-level support for salt tolerance.,S4b,"No homolog/ortholog reports in plants demonstrating CSB/ERCC6 family causally influences salt tolerance traits; available plant salt-tolerance genes belong to other families (e.g., HKT, NHX, TFs).",S5b,PubMed and Google Scholar searches with Oryza sativa + (salt/salinity/NaCl) + (CSB/Os01g0102800/Os01t0102800) did not identify any rice study with causal genetic validation (knockout/overexpression/complementation) directly altering salt tolerance for this gene.,No,No
Os01g0104100,NCA1A,S1b,S2a,"NCA1A encodes a zinc-finger chaperone that activates catalase, a core ROS-scavenging enzyme. ROS detoxification is a central module in rice salinity tolerance; rice NCA1 isoforms redundantly regulate CAT activity.",S3a,"Catalase-mediated H2O2 detoxification occurs in the peroxisome/antioxidant pathways; KEGG peroxisome pathway includes catalase as a ROS-detox component, aligning NCA1A’s function with salt-relevant ROS homeostasis.",S4b,"Arabidopsis NCA1 regulates catalase and multiple abiotic stress responses, but explicit homolog evidence directly demonstrating salt tolerance change is not verified; thus no qualifying S4a.",S5a,"In rice, overexpression of the OsCOIN/OsNCA1A gene (RAP Os01g0104100) causally increased tolerance to salt (NaCl) along with cold and drought, satisfying genetic validation in Oryza sativa.",Yes,Yes
Os01g0124401,RBBI3-3,S1b,S2a,"RBBI3-3 (OsBBTI5/LOC_Os01g03360) encodes an apoplastic Bowman–Birk serine protease inhibitor that interacts with the ROS-scavenging enzyme OsAPX2 and impacts brassinosteroid responses; RNAi lines show altered antioxidant enzyme activities under NaCl, placing it within central salt-tolerance modules involving ROS homeostasis/hormone signaling.",S3a,Functional linkage to the ascorbate–glutathione ROS detoxification pathway via interaction with OsAPX2 (ascorbate peroxidase) and modulation of antioxidant activities under salinity indicates involvement in recognized salt-relevant stress pathways.,S4a,"Homologous Bowman–Birk protease inhibitors in other plants modulate abiotic stress tolerance, including reports of enhanced salt tolerance in soybean lines overexpressing BBI and improved drought tolerance in Arabidopsis expressing maize BBI, supporting a conserved role of BBI-family members in stress resilience.",S5a,"Direct causal validation in rice: RNAi-mediated suppression of OsBBTI5 (the same locus as RBBI3-3/Os01g0124401) increased salt stress tolerance in Oryza sativa, with NaCl explicitly used and phenotypic/biochemical changes documented.",Yes,Yes
OS01G0135700,OsCML16,S1b,S2b,"OsCML16 is a Ca2+-binding calmodulin-like sensor implicated in abiotic stress signaling and root growth/chilling response, but it is not established as a pivotal regulator within core rice salinity tolerance modules (e.g., SOS/CBL–CIPK, HKT1;5-mediated Na+ exclusion).",S3b,"While Ca2+ signaling pathways exist in rice, there is no specific pathway record linking OsCML16 directly to a rice salinity tolerance pathway component in KEGG/Plant Reactome.",S4b,"No ortholog/homolog of OsCML16 with demonstrated causal effects on salt tolerance was found in related model crops; reported salinity phenotypes involve other CMLs (e.g., Arabidopsis CML13/14) or rice paralogs, not clear OsCML16 orthologs.",S5b,Searches in PubMed and Google Scholar for Oryza sativa and (salt/salinity/NaCl) with OsCML16/RAP_ID/Gene_Name found expression/interaction studies and drought/chilling phenotypes. No study with verified PMID/DOI demonstrating genetic manipulation of OsCML16 that causally alters rice salt tolerance.,No,No
