        "reason": "The locus (~0.151–0.156 Mb on chr1 per Ensembl Plants) is outside the fixed main salt QTL on chr1 (11.1–14.6 Mb) and outside other reported chr1 salinity QTL peaks (e.g., ~38.3–38.95 Mb). Supported by rice salt QTL meta-review and recent QTL-seq studies."

        "label": "S2b",
        "reason": "Functional annotations indicate a CSB/ERCC6-like Snf2 chromatin-remodeling ATPase involved in DNA repair/transcriptional processes. While chromatin regulation can modulate stress-responsive genes, CSB is not an established pivotal regulator within central rice salinity tolerance modules (e.g., ion homeostasis SOS/HKT/NHX, ABA core TFs)."

      "S3": {
        "label": "S3b",
        "reason": "Pathway resources emphasize CSB roles in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and chromatin remodeling; no direct mapping to rice salinity-specific pathways (ion transport/ABA/salt tolerance modules) was found using RAP/Ensembl; hence no pathway-level support for salt tolerance."

        "label": "S4b",

      "summary": "Os01g0102800 (CSB) lies near the start of chr1, far from major rice salinity QTL intervals, including the fixed main chr1 QTL (11.1–14.6 Mb). Its CSB/ERCC6-like Snf2 ATPase function is consistent with chromatin remodeling and DNA repair, but there is no direct pathway assignment to rice salt tolerance modules, no supportive ortholog evidence, and no rice genetic validation showing altered salt tolerance upon manipulating this gene. Overall, current evidence does not support a causal role of CSB in Oryza sativa salt tolerance.",
