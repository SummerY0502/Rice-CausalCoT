      "trait_name": "salt tolerance",
      "description": "Chaperone protein regulating catalase (CAT) activity; cold-inducible zinc finger protein; reported tolerance to cold, salt and drought.",
      "position": "chr01:209771..214173 (+ strand)",
      "go": "Molecular Function: protein binding (GO:0005515)",
      "S1": {
        "label": "S1b",
        "reason": "The gene lies at chr1:0.209–0.214 Mb, outside credible rice salt/salinity QTLs on chromosome 1, including the major Saltol locus (~10–12 Mb) and other mapped intervals around 26–39 Mb; therefore no overlap with main-effect salt QTLs."
      },
      "S2": {
        "label": "S2a",
        "reason": "NCA1A encodes a zinc-finger chaperone that activates catalase, a core ROS-scavenging enzyme. ROS detoxification is a central module in rice salinity tolerance; rice NCA1 isoforms redundantly regulate CAT activity."
      },
      "S3": {
        "label": "S3a",
        "reason": "Catalase-mediated H2O2 detoxification occurs in the peroxisome/antioxidant pathways; KEGG peroxisome pathway includes catalase as a ROS-detox component, aligning NCA1A’s function with salt-relevant ROS homeostasis."
      },
      "S4": {
        "label": "S4b",
        "reason": "Arabidopsis NCA1 regulates catalase and multiple abiotic stress responses, but explicit homolog evidence directly demonstrating salt tolerance change is not verified; thus no qualifying S4a."

        "reason": "In rice, overexpression of the OsCOIN/OsNCA1A gene (RAP Os01g0104100) causally increased tolerance to salt (NaCl) along with cold and drought, satisfying genetic validation in Oryza sativa.",

Its function aligns with pivotal ROS-detox modules implicated in rice salinity tolerance, and transgenic overexpression in rice increases salt tolerance, providing causal evidence.",
