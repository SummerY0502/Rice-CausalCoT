OS06G0665500,ROS scavenging/antioxidant network via ABA/ABI5 signaling crosstalk,"The direct causal effect of OS06G0665500 is OR = exp(β) = 0.0066. A 0.0066 (<1) indicates increased expression, weakening salt tolerance. Its function corresponds to that of ROS scavenging/antioxidant network via ABA/ABI5 signaling crosstalk, specifically exerting the enhancement of antioxidant capacity/ROS clearance capacity and modulation of ABA/ABI5 pathway to reduce ROS accumulation and oxidative damage under salt stress, thereby contributing to rice salt tolerance."
